# Python-PortTuning-Calculator

"""This program is a translation of the orginal PortTuning Calculator from Java to Python. I've tried implementing the use of more broad modules and functions in order to allow for easier expansion and updates in the future. I started learning Python about 4 days ago and decided to dive headfirst into it. So far so good but i'm still figuring things out and this hasn't come with it's complications. """
